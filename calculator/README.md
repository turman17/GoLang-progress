# GoLang Calculator Project  

Welcome to my first Go project! This is a simple calculator application that I built while learning the Go programming language. The goal of this project is to practice Go fundamentals and create a functional command-line tool.  

## Features  

- Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
- Command-line interface for input and output.  
- Lightweight and easy to use.  

## How It Works  

1. Run the program from the command line.  
2. Input your calculation in the format:  
    ```bash  
    calc 2 + 3  
    ```  
3. The program will output the result:  
    ```bash  
    Output: 5  
    ```  

## Folder Structure  

```plaintext  
GoLang/  
├── calculator/  
│   ├── add.go  
│   ├── subtract.go  
│   ├── multiply.go  
│   ├── divide.go  
├── cmd/  
│   ├── main.go  
├── README.md  
```  

- **calculator/**: Contains the logic for arithmetic operations.  
- **cmd/**: Contains the entry point of the application.  

## Getting Started  

1. Clone the repository:  
    ```bash  
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GoLang.git  
    ```  
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
    ```bash  
    cd GoLang  
    ```  
3. Run the program:  
    ```bash  
    go run cmd/main.go  
    ```  

## Future Improvements  

- Add support for more complex operations (e.g., exponentiation, square root).  
- Implement error handling for invalid inputs.  
- Add unit tests for all operations.
